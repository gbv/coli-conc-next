With coli-conc, the [VZG](https://www.gbv.de/) provides free [services](#{{ strings.sections.services | localize | slug }}) to access to and exchange of knowledge organisation systems (KOS) and their mappings. This includes:

- uniform access to knowledge organization systems and their metadata with [JSKOS format](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/)
- an open concordance registry to share concept mappings
- the mapping tool [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url }}) to easily create and evaluate mappings
- free [software]({{ "/publications/software/" | url }}) to import and export KOS and mapping data

The current focus is on library classifications Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), Regensburg Classification (RVK), and Basisklassifikation (BK) to build complete concordances for German libraries. The infrastructure can also be used for other systems such as Wikidata and GND.
