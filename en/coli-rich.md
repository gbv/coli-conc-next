**coli-rich** is an application to enrich subject indexing in library catalogs with mappings. The application consists of two parts:

* A web service to query enrichments from
* A web interface to test and experiment with enrichments (see <https://gbv.github.io/coli-rich/>)

Targeted at PICA-based library databases, the application is mainly documented in German. More information can be found [at the German version of this page]({{ "/de/coli-rich/" | url }}) and in the [coli-rich git repository](https://github.com/gbv/coli-rich#readme).
