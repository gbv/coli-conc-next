An **occurrence** gives the number of times a selected concept is used in a given database.  Co-occurrences give the number for combination of concepts so they
can be used as mapping recommendations.  We are woring on an Occurrence API to query GBV databases for [(co-)occurrences in JSKOS](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/jskos.html#concept-occurrences).
